  Generated Interrupt Manager Header File

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    interrupt_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the Interrupt Manager file generated using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description:
    This header file provides implementations for global interrupt handling.
    For individual peripheral handlers please see the peripheral driver for
    all modules selected in the GUI.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.7
        Device            :  PIC18LF26K83
        Driver Version    :  2.12
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.31 and above or later
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X 5.45
